# Mapping Challenge: Is it a map or something else?

China announced this week that it will impose tariffs on US agricultural products. It is a move designed to [target Trump voters in midwestern states](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/04/how-china-will-target-us-agriculture-458530). Media have noted that Trump won most of the states where soybeans are produced.

In my opinion, state level numbers are too imprecise. We need to go to the county level.

The questions:

* Where are soybeans produced in the United States?
* How did Trump perform in those counties?
* What are the population trends in those counties? Could the costs of these tariff's be more than money?

What, in these questions, is a map?

### Data

* [Soybean production in bushels](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hnjx2dazkag62g5/soybeans2012.csv?dl=0), by county in 2012, from the USDA. Most recent data available.
* [Election results by county](https://www.dropbox.com/s/uib1uc6dj0u99wt/2016president__county.csv?dl=0) in 2016, from OpenElex.
* Population data you have from previous assignments.
